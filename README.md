Project Experience:

Advanced TCP Group Chat with Graphical User Interface
- Developed an advanced TCP group chat application with a graphical user interface using Python.
- Utilized socket programming and threading to enable real-time communication between multiple users.
- Implemented the GUI using the tkinter library, providing an intuitive interface for users.
- Features included:
  - Group chat functionality allowing members to communicate with each other in real-time.
  - Display of group members' names for better user interaction.

  - Added functionality for users to delete their own chat messages, offering control over their communication.
  - Implemented the ability for users to reload previous chat history, providing a comprehensive view of conversations before entering the group.

This project not only demonstrated technical proficiency in networking and GUI development but also showcased effective collaboration, user-friendly design principles, and a focus on enhancing user control and experience.
