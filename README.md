Built a TCP chat room where multiple clients can connect to various groups and request changes in the group.
• Multiple clients can connect in real-time with each other, see who left the group and exchange messages with members of
the same group.
• Also, some users can get admin privileges(like kicking someone from the group) by logging in using specific
credentials for admins only.
• Multiple clients can connect in real-time with each other, they can also send messages which only specific people in
the group can see
